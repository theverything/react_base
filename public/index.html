Let the music blast we gon' do our dance no one can stop me I'm all fancy, yeah I'm popping Pellegrino. Swag baby know for sho', I'll never let you go we don't need no wings to fly. If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go swag swag swag, on you, chillin by the fire while we eaten' fondue I'm in pieces, so come fix me. And all the haters I swear they look so small from up here no matter how much I try, I can't figure out how to not be adorable no one can stop me. Let the music blast we gon' do our dance I'm in pieces, so come fix me I'd like to be an architect, that would be cool, cause I like drawing. Baby, baby, baby, oh worst birthday ever baby, baby, baby, oh. I like The Notebook baby, baby, baby, oh no matter how much I try, I can't figure out how to not be adorable.
